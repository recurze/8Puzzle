## 8 Puzzle Game

This project contains programs following different algorithms:
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Iterative Deepening Search
* Dijkstra
* A\* Search
* Iterative Deepening A\* Search

## Motivation

To compare the time and space used by different algorithms as to know which is the best.

## Conclusion

Astar de best.

## Todo

Test; Compare space and time complexity; How close to optimal solution it is.
Update README to include pseudocodes for the algo and basic explanations.
